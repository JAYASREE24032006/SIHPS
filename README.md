## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

Ministry of Environment

## Idea
How about creating an interactive map-based website or mobile app called "E-Waste Locator"? Users can input their location or allow the app to access their current location, and it will display the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facilities on the map. Additionally, the app could provide educational pop-ups or articles on the environmental and health impacts of improper e-waste disposal, raising awareness among users. To incentivize proper disposal, users could earn points or rewards by inputting the model of their old devices and receiving credits relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device when disposed of correctly.
